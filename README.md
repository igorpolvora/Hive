🐝 Hive

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Hive** is a Java console-based application developed to practice and reinforce Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and structured application design.

The project focuses on:

- Domain modeling
- Object composition
- Encapsulation
- Business rule implementation
- Clean package organization

This application simulates a structured system where entities interact according to predefined rules, emphasizing clarity, maintainability, and scalability.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows a layered organization:

```

Hive/
├── src/
│   ├── application/
│   │   └── Program.java
│   ├── entities/
│   └── enums/ (if applicable)
├── README.md
└── .gitignore

````

### 📦 application
Responsible for program execution and user interaction.

### 📦 entities
Contains the domain model and business logic.

### 📦 enums (if present)
Defines controlled constant states used by the system.

## 🎯 Core Concepts Applied

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation of business logic
- Constructor overloading
- Method overriding (`toString`)
- Collections (`ArrayList`, if applicable)
- Separation of concerns
- Defensive input handling

---

## ⚙️ Functional Flow

1. User provides input data.
2. The system instantiates domain objects.
3. Business rules are processed internally.
4. The program outputs structured results to the console.

---

## 📊 Technical Highlights

- Clean object composition
- Clear responsibility separation
- Controlled state management (via enums, if used)
- Consistent formatting with `System.out.printf`
- Predictable time complexity for operations

## 📚 Educational Purpose

This project was built as part of structured Java practice, focusing on improving:

* Logical reasoning
* Clean code practices
* Object modeling
* Console-based system design
